Hello Team 4,

I have done grading of your HW4 NS2 programming assignment. This was the introductory assignment based on NS2 simulation and I believe it was way easier than previous programming assignments. I did not do plagiarism test for this assignment because this assignment was very straightforward and plagiarism test would mess up.

Here is the breakup of your score:
[1] Description and Comments (5 marks): 3 marks
[2] Valid code Submission/Simulation (10 marks): 10 marks
[3] VEGAS/SACK throughput consistensy (15 marks): 15 marks
[4] Conclusion/Explanations (20 marks): 20 marks
[5] Others: 0 marks

Overall Score = 48/50

Remark: Almost Perfect!

Thanks and I hope everything is going good for course projects.
