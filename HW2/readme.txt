Notes from your TA:
-------------------
1. You need to submit TFTP server file along with makefile and readme.txt to Google Drive folder shared to each team.
2. Don't create new folder for submission. Upload your files to teamxx/HW2.
3. I have shared 'temp' folder for your personal (or team) use. You can do compilation or code share among team members using this folder.
4. While submitting, delete all these files and upload only server file, makefile and readme.txt
5. Grading is automated for this programming assignment. You can run "python grading_hw2.py <server_ip> <server_port>" to check your score. 
6. Make sure to check file transfer from different machines. While grading, I'll use different machines for your server and tftp client.

All the best. 

Unix command for starting server:

./server SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT
